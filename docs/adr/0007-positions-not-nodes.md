# ADR 0007 — Positions, not nodes: the repertoire data model

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-05

## Context

A repertoire is a set of opening lines, and progress has to hang on something.
The obvious choice is the node in the move tree: this line, this ply, this card.

Chess makes that choice wrong, because of **transpositions** — different move
orders reaching the identical position. `1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 d5` and
`1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6` end in the same place by different routes.

## Decision

**Progress is keyed by position, never by node in a tree.**

The key is the **first four FEN fields**: piece placement, side to move,
castling rights, en-passant square. The halfmove clock and fullmove number are
dropped — they record *how you arrived*, not what the position is.

The same key is used for catalogue lookup (naming a position) and for the
repertoire (what has been practised).

## Rationale

**A per-node design cannot represent a position reached two ways.** The same
position appears as two unrelated cards, drilled twice, with progress split
between them — and the app cannot tell Felix he already knows this.

**The failure appears late, which is what makes it dangerous.** With three
lines nothing looks wrong. It surfaces once a repertoire has grown, which is
both the worst time to discover it and the point at which migrating stored
progress is painful.

**Four independent projects converge on it** — ChessTempo, Chessbook,
OpeningTree and chessdriller all key by position. Unanimity across tools that
share no code is strong evidence.

**En passant stays in the key.** A position where the capture is legal genuinely
is a different position — the legal moves differ. Dropping it would merge two
positions that play differently.

**Castling rights stay** for the same reason: they change what is legal.

**The clock fields go**, because they make the *same* position look different
depending on the route taken, which is precisely the bug being avoided.
Verified in this repo: the two move orders above produce different full FENs and
an identical four-field key.

## Consequences

**Positive:** Transpositions merge for free. Practising a position once counts,
however it was reached.

**Positive:** Catalogue naming works on positions Felix reaches by a move order
the line did not anticipate — the catalogue's actual job.

**Negative:** The key is a ~60-character string per card rather than a small
integer id. Measured at about 2 KB for 150 cards (ADR 0008), so it does not
matter.

**Negative:** A position carries no memory of the line that reached it. Anything
route-dependent needs the tree alongside the key, not instead of it.

## Alternatives considered

**Node ids in the tree** — simpler and smaller, and wrong for the reason above.

**A hash of the four fields** — shorter, but debugging becomes guesswork and the
space saving is irrelevant at this size.
